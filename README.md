# Governance, Risk & Compliance Audit

This project was part of a course I took, which gave me the opportunity to get some hands on lab experience. Here is what I learned through my projects: 
- Prepared, executed, and reported on audit of subset of NIST SP 800-53 cybersecurity controls to include interview, document review, and testing of systems to support compliance audit activities.
- Became knowledgeable on NIST Cybersecurity Framework and how the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover categories comprise and facilitate an information security program.
- Developed Just-In-Time, concise, tailored cybersecurity awareness content for emerging threats, improving targeted end-user base cyber hygiene, with the use of tools such as Canva & Pexels
- Performed semi-quantitative cybersecurity risk analysis using NIST SP 800-30 methodology to identify the highest-risk weaknesses in a system
- Executed threat modeling exercise to determine higher likelihood threat events to inform cybersecurity risk modeling.
- Developed an Information Security policy to establish authorized access management and authenticator management for internal and third-party personnel.
